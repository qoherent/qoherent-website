At Qoherent, we specialize in creating custom RF (Radio Frequency) datasets tailored to your specific needs. Whether you're training machine learning models, developing RF algorithms, or conducting research, our dataset development services can provide you with the high-quality data you require. 

We understand the importance of data interoperability. That's why we support industry-standard formats, including SIGMF, to ensure compatibility with your existing tools and workflows.

Whether you need a small dataset for a specific project or a massive dataset for large-scale experiments, we have the resources and expertise to handle dataset curation exercises of any scale.


## Dataset Synthesis

Our experts can generate synthetic RF datasets for a wide range of scenarios and applications, including:

- Space-based communications and sensing environments.
- 5G, LTE, and standard cellular environments.
- ISM band
- Radars
- Vehicular communications

Whether you need data for simulating wireless communication networks, IoT devices, or any other RF environment, Qoherent can help.

## Recording Capture and Curation

We offer comprehensive recording capture and curation services,  including:

- **Testbed design and development** - In addition to custom datasets, we can create emulators and testbeds using popular commercially available Software-Defined Radios (SDRs). This allows you to test your RF systems in controlled environments and evaluate their performance under various conditions. We can emulate any scenario we can synthesize (above).
- **Over the air** - We can build datasets based on recordings of recording ambient over-the-air data, by capturing relevant ambient signals in real-world scenarios, giving you access to real-world RF signals for research, analysis, and testing purposes. 
- **Labelling** - We offer both automated and human-led RF dataset labelling.

Our team utilizes state-of-the-art equipment and techniques to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the captured RF data.

Contact us today to discuss your custom RF dataset development needs. Our team is ready to work closely with you to create the ideal dataset that meets your design requirements.
