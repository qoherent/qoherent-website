<!-- ## Machine learning for passive RF signal processing -->

At Qoherent, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of radio signal processing solutions through cutting-edge research, machine learning, and quantum computing. We collaborate with a diverse range of partners, including government labs, corporate researchers, and universities, to lead and contribute to active projects that shape the future of RF technology.

## Research Activities

We offer end-to-end research and prototyping services for any stage of a project, including:

- Reviewing and consulting on state-of-the-art methods for performing radio signal classification.
- Designing and experimenting with algorithmic solutions for classifying radio signals.
- Replicating and advancing peer-reviewed research in the field.
- Designing and developing software-defined radio (SDR)-based testbeds, from two radios to large channel emulators.

## Engineering Activities

Our engineering team specializes in transforming cutting-edge research into practical solutions. Our engineering activities include:

- Further designing and experimenting with algorithmic solutions for classifying radio signals.
- Dataset creation, model design, and training for machine learning applications.
- Integrating and deploying models into existing software or systems.
- General systems integration with SDRs to create fully functional RF systems.

## Software

Qoherent's research and development work is greatly facilitated by our proprietary Radio Intelligence Application (RIA). RIA serves as a powerful tool to:

- Control and manage testbeds efficiently.
- Create and manipulate datasets for research and development.
- Design, train, and fine-tune machine learning models.
- Conduct extensive testing and evaluation of model performance.

Access to RIA is provided as an integral part of all development projects, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the prototyping process.
